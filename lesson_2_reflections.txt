What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up the process to start saving commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a subset of the directory. 
It allows you to include only relevant files in commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If changes in more than one file are necessary 
for a full single logical change, the stating area helps.
